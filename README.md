# Autonomous battery decision-making in complex environments using machine learning algorithms

This research will contribute to the design and development  of the algorithms and predictive models that to operate the growing energy storage facilities around the world.

Energy storage is a highly flexible resource with limited capacity to store energy. Managing future uncertainty in operations is critical to managing storage resources across all applications. Whether itâ€™s developing price forecasting models for energy market participation or exploring historical operations data to optimize the operations of the storage systems and to translate the potential of energy storage into reality.

The outcomes of this research would be to construct and fit statistical, machine learning, or optimization models that enable autonomous battery decision-making across a range of complex environments and applications. The project deliverables would be listed as follows:

Production modeling code
Implement algorithms in production
Design and run both simulated and live dispatch experiments
Analyze experimental and observational data
